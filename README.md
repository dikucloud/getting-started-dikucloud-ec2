# DIKU-Cloud student projects on Amazon EC2

The DIKU cloud initiative is aimed at [DIKU](http://www.diku.dk/) students, who want to do projects using resources on the Amazon EC2 cloud computing platform. 

Cloud projects are special because it is difficult to do one without actually spending money. We have taken care of most of the money issues, so you can focus on technology and computer science related to cloud computing. All you have to do is to make a rough budget of the cloud resources you'll need in your project, and we take care of the rest. See the [getting started](https://github.com/dikucloud/getting-started-dikucloud-ec2/blob/master/start.md) page for more details. 

The funds we have for student projects are of course limited, but right now there are still plenty of credits to use for student projects.
