# DIKU-Cloud student projects on Amazon EC2

The DIKU cloud initiative is aimed at [DIKU](http://www.diku.dk/) students, who want to do projects related to cloud computing. Cloud projects are special because it is difficult to do one without spending real money. This is because the cloud infrastructure is owned by private companies. The aim of the DIKU cloud initiative to remove the monetary barrier, so students can learn about the technological and computer science aspects of cloud computing.

The DIKU cloud EC2 projects have been made possible due to a generous [AWS in Education grant award](http://aws.amazon.com/education/).
