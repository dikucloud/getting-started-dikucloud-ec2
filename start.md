## How to start your own cloud project

When you're ready, send an email to kostas@diku.dk

First, make a rough budget for your usage on Amazon EC2. Don't worry, it is not hard. Use the Amazon EC2 Calculator (link below) to make the budget. Don't worry if it is not 100% accurate, just make an effort to make it roughly so (a [back-of-the-envelope calculation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-of-the-envelope_calculation)).

When you are done with your budget and have saved it, you'll get an URL for sharing. Write down/copy this URL.
