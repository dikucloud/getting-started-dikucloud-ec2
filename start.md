# Start you own DIKU cloud Amazon EC2 project

## How to start your own cloud project

When you're ready, send an email to kostas@diku.dk

First, make a rough budget for your usage on Amazon EC2. Don't worry, it is not hard. Use the Amazon EC2 Calculator (link below) to make the budget. Don't worry if it is not 100% accurate, just make an effort to make it roughly so (a [back-of-the-envelope calculation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-of-the-envelope_calculation)).

When you are done with your budget and have saved it, you'll get an URL for sharing. Write down/copy this URL.

Here is a template you can use for your email to kostas@diku.dk

When your application has been processed, you'll get an email with further instructions.

## Why do we ask for your Github username?

To encourage sharing of knowledge among DIKU students and staff, a [Github](https://github.com/) repository will be automatically created as part of your project. If you supply your Github username(s), you will be added as collaborators to the project, and will be able to commit code, latex or whatever you feel is relevant. 

Collecting the project repositories under the [dikucloud](https://github.com/dikucloud/) Github account, makes it easy for others to find your project, and benefit from your new cloud knowhow.

If you do not wish to share your project with others, that is of course perfectly ok. Simply leave the repository empty (and eventually deleted).

If you do not give your usernames right away, they can always be added later. Simply write an email to kostas@diku.dk, and ask that you be added as collaborator. We can only add you as collaborator to your own projects, but what you do after that is up to you!
