# Start you own DIKU cloud Amazon EC2 project

## Terms for projects

Because the EC2 credits are awarded to students through an [AWS in Education grant award](http://aws.amazon.com/education/), there are a few limitations to how the credits can be used:

* It is not possible to allocate Reserved Instances. This is not a technical limitation, as all instance types can be allocated as On-Demand instances on EC2.
* The credits awarded to students must be used exclusively to support their university project.

Details on the grant's terms and conditions can be found here: [http://aws.amazon.com/education/terms/](http://aws.amazon.com/education/terms/)

## How to start your own cloud project

You apply to access to EC2 credits by sending an email to kostas@diku.dk

In this email you need to include a rough budget for your usage on Amazon EC2. Don't worry, it is not hard. Use the Amazon EC2 Calculator (link below) to make the budget. The budget does not have to be 100% accurate, aim at making a good [back-of-the-envelope calculation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-of-the-envelope_calculation).

When you have finished your EC2 budget and have saved it, you'll get an URL for sharing the budget. Write down/copy this URL.

Here is a template you can use for your email

When you have filled in the missing information, send an email to kostas@diku.dk

Once your application has been processed, you'll get an email with further instructions on how to get started.

## Why do we ask for your Github username?

To encourage sharing of cloud computing knowledge at DIKU, a [Github](https://github.com/) repository will automatically be created for your project. If you supply your Github username(s), they will be added as collaborators on this project, and you will be able to submit your code, latex or whatever else you feel is relevant to share with fellow students and staff.

We have collected the project repositories under the [dikucloud](https://github.com/dikucloud/) Github account to make it easy for others to find out about your project, and elevate the general cloud competences at DIKU.

If you do not wish to share your project details with others, that is of course perfectly ok (just leave the automatically created repository empty).

If you do not give your usernames right away, they can always be added later by writing an email to kostas@diku.dk.
